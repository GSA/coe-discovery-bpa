# Frequently asked questions

## Question
*Will the CoEs use the Discovery BPA for all procurements and at every agency?*

### Answer
While we intend for the Discovery BPA to be available to each and every Agency Partner, the focus of the solicitation is to obtain services required to successfully complete the discovery/assessment stage, which we have been calling “Phase One.” The BPA is *not* intended to be used for our implementation stage, which we have been calling “Phase Two.”

## Question
*What is the anticipated period of performance for each order under the BPA?*

### Answer
A typical CoE Phase One effort is approximately six months. However, the actual duration will depend wholly on the agency partner’s needs. Therefore, each order may have a different period of performance.

## Question
*Will all functional areas be included at every new CoE agency?*

### Answer
No, the CoEs will work with each partner agency and identify which functional areas are required to meet their actual needs. The CoEs anticipate that the number and composition of functional areas will vary by partner agency.

## Questions
*Will functional areas be combined at the order level?*

### Answer
It will depend on the agency partner’s needs. For example, the Contact Center functional area may include work within the Customer Experience functional area. The intention of the BPA is to have the flexibility to combine those areas at the order level, should it be necessary.

## Question
*How many orders are anticipated per CoE?*

### Answer
There is no estimated number, as it will completely depend on the requirements of each agency partner.

## Question
*What is the total anticipated number of awards at the BPA level? At the order level?*

### Answer
The intention is to setup a multi-award BPA, with three to five awardees, per functional area, but the final number of awards will be dependent on the number of quotes received and the evaluation process itself.

At the order level, there is no estimated number of awards, as it will completely depend on the requirements of each agency partner.

## Question
*What is the estimated value of each order?*

### Answer
There is no estimated value, as it will completely depend on the requirements of each CoE.

## Question
*Will there be an order issued or awarded when the Discovery BPA is awarded?*

### Answer
No, the first order(s) will follow after the BPA is setup.

## Question
*TTS just released an RFI for a “Centers of Excellence Discovery Blanket Purchase Agreement.” From the looks of it, this seems to be Phase One support. Is this a replacement (or recompete) for the current CoE Phase One support contracts?*

### Answer
It is not a recompete or a replacement, it is a new approach, building on the lessons learned from our current efforts, using the feedback gained from the initial group of contractors we worked with, the contractors who participated in all our previous procurements, as well as our own CoE teams.

## Question
*Is this the last procurement that you are going to do for CoE work?*

### Answer
No, this procurement is for new Phase One work only. We anticipate that there will be additional procurements for Phase Two implementation work.
