# Sample Questions

These are sample challenge questions and a sample scenario question you can reference when developing your own.

## Challenge Questions

### Change Management

The Agency does not have a history of embracing change or proactively taking action steps to futureproof the agency for the 21st century. Furthermore, the Agency has number of distinct components spread out across both geographically and with siloed mission areas — each with unique operational requirements and diverse work cultures.

The Change Management team needs to coordinate with all CoE’s and the appropriate Agency stakeholders to propose high impact priorities for component organizations to receive concentrated technical training. The Change Management team is centered around workforce needs assessments and uses a flexible framework to realign, re/upskill, and migrate agency staff to the appropriate roles with the right skill sets for the Agency’s future state. Future state is meant to be iterative which means learning and adopting universal 21st century competencies and promoting contemporary modes of working.

**What is your approach to drive the following outcomes: (1) Determining where things stand now; (2) Outlining the path forward for Implementation; and, (3) Ensuring modernization efforts continue beyond Implementation.**

### Customer Experience

The Agency offers a range services and has broad optimization ideas. However, the Agency cannot clearly identify nor measure the customer base with a uniform set of KPIs. Currently, customers are identified as “everyone” and approximately half of the agency’s resources are passed through a series of non-governmental intermediaries without tracking their delivery to customers. The Customer Experience team needs to craft a strategic recommendation to help the Agency begin to take small steps towards big transformation, by first prioritizing and clearly articulating touch points and services related to a specific customer segment’s journey. Focused recommendations also include clear links to product solutions or operational improvements that draw on other CoEs (i.e. a contact center specialist triages senior citizen calls to help navigate a new online service request form with large font - 508 Compliance for the visually impaired).

### Data Analytics

The Data Analytics CoE needs to identify high impact opportunities within a small Agency to modernize analytics infrastructure with the goal of improving data driven decision making and mission delivery. A modern data and analytics infrastructure can enable the development of many technologies and practices such as agency-wide measurable KPIs, dashboarding, and operationalized customer feedback metrics as well as advanced analytics applications like AI, machine learning, and predictive modeling. There are many agency programs that could be modernized but resources are finite and time is limited. You will have to select where to focus your efforts, determine how you will evaluate potential solutions, and your solutions must be scalable for an Agency with widely differing constituencies, strategic goals, and analytics capabilities. You need to meet agency staff and leadership where they are as well as facilitating a process that will lead to the agency’s rapid and dramatic modernization.

## Scenario Question

The CoE team is a network of dynamic people and capabilities who work together and drive holistic digital transformation. An Agency Partner is a cabinet-level department with a number of distinct components consisting of siloed mission areas each with unique operational requirements, a distinct lack of accessible documentation and cohesive metrics, variable work cultures, and often different geographic locations. The Agency Partner components do not have a history of sustaining collaboration, nor consistent communication or uniform data capture or data sharing across dividing lines.

The CoEs are interrelated and model a 21st Century culture of work that transcends siloes of yesteryear. It is the CoE’s job to help the Agency Partner leverage the power of modern IT to collaborate across typically siloed domains, develop a shared analytics infrastructure, design secure and modern customer experiences, and improve service delivery to citizens. As a potential vendor, it is your job to facilitate open lines of communication and collaboration between not only the CoE teams, but also at the intersections with the Agency partners, and your fellow vendor colleagues.

**How would you obtain agency-wide buy-in for the modernization efforts promoted by the CoE while also linking efforts and fostering collaboration with other vendors and government staff across all of the Centers at the Agency Partner?**
