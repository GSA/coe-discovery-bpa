# Frequently asked questions

## Question
*Will the CoEs use the Discovery BPA for all procurements and at every agency?*

### Answer
While we intend for the Discovery BPA to be accessible to each and every CoE, the focus of the solicitation is to obtain services required to successfully complete the discovery/assessment stage, which we have been calling “Phase 1.” The BPA is *not* intended to be used for our implementation stage, which we have been calling “Phase 2.”

## Question
*What is the anticipated period of performance for each call order under the BPA?*

### Answer
A typical CoE Phase 1 effort is approximately six months. However, the actual duration will depend wholly on the customer/end user needs. Therefore, each call order may have a different period of performance.

## Question
*Will all functional areas be included at every new CoE agency?*

### Answer
No, each partner agency will use the CoEs that address their actual needs.

## Question
*How many call orders are anticipated per CoE?*

### Answer
There is no estimated number, as it will completely depend on the requirements of each CoE.

## Question
*What is the total anticipated number of awards?*

### Answer
There is no estimated number, as it will completely depend on the requirements of each CoE.

## Question
*What is the estimated value of each call order?*

### Answer
There is no estimated value, as it will completely depend on the requirements of each CoE.

## Question
*Will there be a call order issued or awarded when the Discovery BPA is awarded?*

### Answer
At this point, that decision has not yet been made.

## Question
*TTS just released an RFI for a “Centers of Excellence Discovery Blanket Purchase Agreement.”  From the looks of it, this seems to be Phase 1 support. Is this a replacement (or recompete) for the current CoE Phase 1 support contracts?*

### Answer
It is not a recompete or a replacement, it is a new approach, building on the lessons learned from our current efforts, using the feedback gained from the initial group of vendors we worked with, the vendors who participated in all our previous procurements, as well as our own CoE teams.

## Question
*Is this the last procurement that you are going to do for CoE work?*

### Answer
No, this procurement is for new Phase 1 work only. We anticipate that there will be additional procurements for Phase 2 implementation work.
