## GSA Issues Discovery BPA for Centers of Excellence

**June 4, 2019**

WASHINGTON - The U.S. General Services Administration’s Technology Transformation Services, along with the team in GSA Region 1 Assisted Acquisition Services, issued the Centers of Excellence (CoE) Discovery Blanket Purchase Agreement (Discovery BPA) on May 21, 2019. The Discovery BPA will provide the CoE and future agency partners the flexibility and speed necessary to perform numerous discovery and assessment efforts at multiple agencies, simultaneously.

GSA incorporated the feedback received from industry to make significant and innovative changes to the evaluation process, allowing for greater small business participation. As a result, the Discovery BPA will give the CoE a contract vehicle that includes partners who demonstrate a fundamental understanding of the challenges—and solutions—facing IT modernization efforts.

“With just about a third of the agreements going to small businesses, we are proud of the cross-section of American industry and technological expertise represented,” said GSA CoE Executive Director Bob De Luca. “We selected companies who demonstrated the potential to discover issues related to current legacy systems and develop recommendations for modern-day technological solutions to the problems our citizens face when interacting with government services.”
